TODO 

[] Read the Rice Vector Library manual.

[] Method for generating random elements (ie, vectors) from domain and
range of operator. Note: special cases such as real FFT. Useful for
dot-tests.

[] opGaussian (and related implicit random matrices): Not sure if
the RNG advancement is being done consistently.  If the "internal"
routines are allocating random m-vectors column-by-column, shouldn't
the advancement also be done column-by-column?

[] opBlockDiag.m; Avoid replicating operator explicitly?
                  How to display repeated blocks: opBlockDiag(ones(10,1),opDCT(4))?
   make sure help comment mentions weight vector in combination with a single
   operator as well.
[] @opSpot/diag.m; add documentation

[] opInverse.m: Should we allow operators such as opInverse on
   non-linear operators? NO!!! Check linear flag. LIKEWISE for PCG, LSQR, ...

[] Clean up multiplication implementations, see e.g., opCurvelet
[] opWavelet.m: Help comment
[] opToeplitz.m, opToepGauss.m, opToepSign.m: Help comment
[] Copy correct version of RWT (with 64-bit code problem resolved)
[] Comments in the @opSpot files
[] Set ID property in SVN
[] opSurfacelet.m: Haven't got a clue about how to use? Still have to test.
[] For each operator, check if complexity, linear flag needs to be set or not
[] opSubsRef.m, opSubsAsgn.m, opExcise.m: Add proper help
[] Check constructor comment block in each file
[] DCT, DCT2, FFT, FFT2, HAAR, HAAR2, WAVELET, WAVELET2; THESE ARE
DERIVED FROM opOrthogonal.
[] Redundant wavelet transform: RWavelet, RWavelet2.
