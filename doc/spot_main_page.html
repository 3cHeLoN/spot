<h1>Spot: A Linear-Operator Toolbox</h1>

<p>Linear operators are at the core of many of the most basic algorithms
for signal and image processing. Matlab&rsquo;s high-level, matrix-based
language allows us to naturally express many of the underlying matrix
operations (e.g., computation of matrix-vector products and
manipulation of matrices) and is thus a powerful platform on which to
develop concrete implementations of these algorithms. Many of the most
useful operators, however, do not lend themselves to the explicit
matrix representations that Matlab provides. The aim of the Spot
Toolbox is to bring the expressiveness of Matlab&rsquo;s built-in matrix
notation to problems for which explicit matrices are not practical.</p>
<p>Please visit the <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spot">Spot website</a> to
download the latest version of the toolbox.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>System requirements</h3>
<p>The Spot toolbox requires Matlab version <b>R2008a or later</b>.  In
particular, Spot makes extensive use of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; object-oriented
features (defined by the &ldquo;classdef&rdquo; keyword) that were introduced in
the first quarter of 2008 later. It&rsquo;s been extensively tested against
R2009a and R2009b. Please make sure to email one of the authors if you
notice some incompatibility.</p>
<h3>Basic installation</h3>
<p>Spot is prepackaged with all of its required dependencies, and
the core functionality will work out-of-the-box.  The first step
is to add the &ldquo;spot&rdquo; directory to your Matlab path:</p>
<div class="codeblock">
<div class="blockcontent"><pre>
addpath /path/to/spot/directory
</pre></div></div>
<p>See
the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_env/f10-26235.html">MATLAB documentation for setting the search path</a>.</p>
<h3>MEX file compilation</h3>
<p>Spot includes several Wavelet operators via the
<a href="http://dsp.rice.edu/software/rice-wavelet-toolbox">Rice Wavelet
Toolbox</a> (RWT) provides the backend. Spot includes precompiled MEX
interfaces to the RWT for various platforms. If the included MEX
binaries are not compatible with your system, however, then use the
command <tt>spotSetup</tt> at the Matlab prompt. This will compile the RWT
MEX interfaces for the current system. If no errors are displayed,
then the compilation was successful; otherwise, send us a bug report.</p>
