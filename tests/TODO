Observed abnormalities:
-diag(opEye(m,1)) & diag(opEye(1,n)) are different from the one from matlab
-normest(opZeros(m,n)) gives out NaN
-opDCT only takes one input, manual needs to be updated.
-opHaar(32,32,1) does not work
-opToeplitz(m,n,vect) where length(vect)=max(m,n) doesn't work
-opFFT(n) doesn't work
